# TreasureIsland_Game
A simple Treasure Island game using if, elif and else.

'elif' is used if you want more than one output if there is more than two choices available. In this case, the three coloured doors to choose from.

Otherwise 'else' would be fine.

\n is used at the end of each input line to allow the user to enter their choices on a new line (which is very handy)

.lower() registers all variants of the allowed inputs as lower case.
